    that cache.

    test (or class). The shim is then skipped; see `verify_first_compat_predicate`
    and `docs/en/verify-glossary.md` (test shim).

    the config from the cwd, and enabled a gate in the developer's own project.

    gitignored — so the only visible symptom was a WinError 32 when two suites
    ran at once, which reads exactly like a flake.

    (memory #236) is WHAT gets written: the set of enabled gates, i.e. the thing
    the project is checked WITH. The same code path that enables a gate can
    disable one, and then the project silently verifies less than it reports.
    A defect that rewrites the evidence of itself has to be caught by something
    that does not depend on anyone noticing.
