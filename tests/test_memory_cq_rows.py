"""cq rows in a memory-search result must not masquerade as local memories.

Cross-project `cq` knowledge is appended to the same result list as this
project's own memories. It used to be emitted with ``id: 0`` — an address that
collides across every cq hit and points at a record that does not exist, so a
caller feeding a search result back into ``memory_show``/``memory_link`` got a
confusing miss instead of a clear "not addressable".
