"""Failing gate runs must be recorded — and must never be replayed as green.

l26-gate-results-persist shipped with recording tied to cache eligibility
(`passed and cache_ok and has_real_pass`), so a blocking failure from the
service path was never written to gate_runs. The one question the table exists
to answer — how often does a gate actually block — was unanswerable for exactly
the runs that matter.

The dangerous half of the fix is the other direction: a recorded run must not
become a cache hit. Two guards, both asserted here — failures carry
exit_code=1 (and both lookups filter exit_code=0), and a run that passed but is
not cacheable gets a command prefix neither lookup can match.
