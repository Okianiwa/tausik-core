"""Tests for verify_cache.has_fresh_verify_run — Verify-First Contract.

The lookup is strict-only: a green counts for a `task_done` iff it was
recorded for the same slug, the same file set (by hash), and the same gate
signature, within the TTL.

Historical note — this file used to pin the OPPOSITE contract. A relaxed
fallback accepted any fresh green whose recorded command named no files
("manual scope", Sharp edge #2 / gotcha #111) as a certificate for an
arbitrary explicit file set, so that `tausik verify` without `--task` could
satisfy a follow-up `task_done`. verify-cache-empty-scope-hit removed it: with
no declared files `gate_runner` SKIPS the scoped gates, so such a run proved
nothing about the files it was certifying, and `compute_files_hash([])` is a
stable empty-marker that no edit moves — the green stayed valid for the whole
TTL across arbitrary tree changes. The convenience was real; what it was
built on was not.

The empty-scope contract itself is pinned in test_verify_cache_empty_scope.py.
