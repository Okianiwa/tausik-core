"""r14-qwen-parity-or-honesty: Qwen Code hooks must match Claude Code.

Pre-1.4 the Qwen bootstrap quietly omitted four hooks that Claude shipped:
- brain_search_proactive (PreToolUse on Web*)
- brain_post_webfetch (PostToolUse on WebFetch)
- task_call_counter (PostToolUse on every tool)
- activity_event (PostToolUse on every tool)

The README claimed "same SENAR enforcement as Claude Code" — so users on
Qwen Code lost gap-based active-time tracking, call-budget warnings, and
shared-brain plumbing without knowing it. This test compares the hook
command set between the two generators and fails if they drift again.
