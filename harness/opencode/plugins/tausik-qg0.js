// active TAUSIK task is refused. Without this file, "OpenCode support" is just
// markdown the host is free to ignore — and it does (AGENTS.md is
// first-matching-file-wins, so a user's own file shadows ours forever).
//
// HARD RULE — ZERO IMPORTS. Not `require`, not `import`, not even a type-only
// import of `@opencode-ai/plugin`. That exact import is what killed the user's
// host: OpenCode tried to resolve a nonexistent @local version, threw
// ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND, and took the whole prompt loop down with it. Types come
// from JSDoc. This file must run with nothing installed.
//
// Runtime globals only: `process` (env, platform) and, when present, `Bun`
// (used solely to make the cache exact — see _dbSignature).
